WarDriver
=========

WarDriver allows you to easily conduct a Wi-Fi survey and upload it to the WarDriver repository. It uses the powerful kismet backbone to find wireless access points and provides you an easy to use GUI for surveying on the go. This particular version was built for a touch screen Raspberry Pi using the Adafruit PiTFT 2.8" screen.
